WordPress Installation with Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP on Ubuntu 20.04
This repository contains Ansible playbooks and templates to set up one or more WordPress sites on an Ubuntu 20.04 server using Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP. Additionally, it includes a playbook for cleaning up the environment if you need to reinstall, as well as a backup playbook.

Requirements
Ansible installed on your control machine
Ubuntu 20.04 server(s) with SSH access
Open ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) for web traffic
Basic knowledge of Ansible and server configuration
Variables
General Variables
domain: The domain name or IP address for your first site.
second_domain: The domain name or IP address for your second site.
ubuntu_user: The username for your Ubuntu server (default: ubuntu).
php_version: Version of PHP to be installed (e.g., "8.2").
db_name: The name of the WordPress database for the first site.
db_name_second: The name of the WordPress database for the second site.
db_user: The username for the WordPress databases.
wordpress_install_dir: Installation directory for the WordPress site.
second_wordpress_install_dir: Installation directory for the second WordPress site.
backup_dir: Directory to store backup files on the remote host.
Secret Variables
The sensitive data (e.g., passwords) are managed using two separate files:

vars_secret.yaml: Secret variables for the first site.
vars_secret_second.yaml: Secret variables for the second site.
You need to create these files with the following structure:

yaml
Copy code
# vars_secret.yaml
db_password: your_db_password
root_db_password: your_root_db_password
wordpress_admin_password: your_wordpress_admin_password
wordpress_admin_email: your_email

# vars_secret_second.yaml
db_password: your_db_password_second
root_db_password: your_root_db_password_second
wordpress_admin_password: your_wordpress_admin_password_second
wordpress_admin_email: your_email_second
Usage
Install the First WordPress Site
To install the first WordPress site:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts install_wordpress.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
This playbook sets up the first WordPress site at the specified domain. It installs Nginx, MariaDB, PHP, and configures the server.

Obtain SSL Certificates
To secure your site with SSL, run:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts certbot.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
This playbook uses Certbot to obtain and install an SSL certificate for your WordPress site.

Install the Second WordPress Site
To install a second WordPress site on the same server:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts install_second_wordpress.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
This playbook sets up a second WordPress site with its own database and user credentials, without interfering with the first site.

Clean Up the Host for Reinstallation
If you need to clean up the server for a fresh installation:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts cleanup_host.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
This playbook stops and removes all installed services (Nginx, MariaDB, PHP), and deletes configuration and data files, returning the server to a clean state.

Backup WordPress Site
To create a backup of the WordPress site:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts backup_wordpress.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
This playbook will backup both the WordPress files and database for the site specified in vars.yaml and store the backups on the Ansible host.

Templates Explanation
fastcgi-php.conf.j2: Configuration snippet for handling PHP requests in Nginx.
fastcgi_params.j2: Defines parameters for FastCGI processes.
mime.types.j2: Provides MIME type mappings for Nginx.
nginx.conf.j2: Basic configuration file for Nginx.
nginx_wordpress.j2: Nginx configuration for serving the first WordPress site (HTTP only).
nginx_wordpress_ssl.j2: Nginx configuration for serving the first WordPress site with SSL.
nginx_wordpress_ssl_second.j2: Nginx configuration for serving the second WordPress site with SSL.
wp-config.php.j2: The main configuration file for WordPress, customized for the first site.
wp-config_second.j2: Configuration file for the second WordPress site.
Multiple Sites
You can use these playbooks to manage multiple WordPress sites on the same server. Each site will have its own database, user credentials, and SSL certificate. The provided templates ensure that configurations for each site do not conflict.

Example Workflow
Install the first WordPress site:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts install_wordpress.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
Obtain an SSL certificate:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts certbot.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
Install the second WordPress site:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts install_second_wordpress.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
If needed, clean up the server:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts cleanup_host.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
Create a backup of the site:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i hosts backup_wordpress.yaml --vault-password-file ~/ansible/.vault_pass.txt
